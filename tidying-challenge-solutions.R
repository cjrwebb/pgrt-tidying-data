# Tidying Challenge: data/sotkanet-data.xls

#' This data is from the Sotkanet.fi (https://sotkanet.fi/sotkanet/en/index)
#' statistical data service, which contains a wide range of interesting
#' municipal data from Finland. The major challenge of tidying this data 
#' comes from the fact that the years are given in the columns, and the 
#' rows represent variable, year, municipality observations. We want to
#' switch this over so that each row represents an observation in a given
#' year, for a specific municipality, and each column represents a variable.
#' 
#' Difficulty: Easy
#' - This is quite a typical and useful example of official statistical 
#' releases across many countries


sotka <- read_xls("data/sotkanet-data.xls") 
sotka

# First, pivot the data longer using the year columns
sotka <- sotka %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = `1990`:`2023`,
    names_to = "year"
  )
sotka

# Then, rename the variables without names and remove the
# variable id name (or combine with the variable); having 
# two variable keys will cause problems with the join as
# it will treat it as part of the unique row identifier. We
# can drop population too as it's the same for all (combined
# rather than split into male/female)
sotka <- sotka %>% 
  rename(
    variable = 1,
    variable_id = 2,
    municipality = 3,
    municipality_id = 4,
    population = 5
  ) %>%
  select(-variable_id, -population)
sotka  

# Then, let's use our variable indicator to turn out
# variables into columns
sotka <- sotka %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = variable,
    values_from = value
  )
sotka

# Finally, let's tidy up the names of our columns using
# some generated short names. I'll also save a copy of 
# the original names for reference.

var_desc <- names(sotka)

  "other_exp_net",     # Operating net expenditure on other non-institutional services for children

)

# create a codebook
sotka_codebook <- tibble(names = c(names(sotka)[1:3], labels), var_desc)
sotka_codebook

# Assign the names to the variables
names(sotka) <- sotka_codebook$names

# Drop the footer that become a column
sotka <-sotka %>%
  select(-thl_sotkanet)

# Make year into a numeric variable
sotka <- sotka %>% mutate(year = as.numeric(year))


# Final result:
sotka

# This would likely require further processing due to the amount 
# of missing data

# Tidying Challenge: data/mortality-nomis.xlsx

#' Successfully read and tidy the above spreadsheet so that all of the
#' numeric variables are of the proper type, that missing values are 
#' detected as missing. Turn the data into a long format, where each
#' row represents a region for a specific year for a specific gender 
#' (all,  male, female) and each column represents the number or
#' rate of the mortality statistic.

# Difficulty: Medium (but tedious!)
# - It would be easier to try and read in each section and then join
#   them all together at the end!


# Solution ----------------------------------------------------------------

# Read in each section of the spreadsheet that refers to different 
# measures:
